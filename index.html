        My research focuses on computational social science and time series modeling:
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Team composition in online gaming</b>: Team composition is a central factor in determining the effectiveness of a team. To explore the intristic properties of compositions in the real-world teams, we present a large-scale study on the effect of team composition on multiple measures (performance, tenacity and rapport) of team effectiveness based on a dataset from Honor of Kings, the largest multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. Our results confirm the importance of team diversity with respect to player roles, and also contributes to the situation vs. personality debate in the literature.(<a href="/publications/www19-137.pdf">Ziqiang et al., WWW'19</a>)</li>
